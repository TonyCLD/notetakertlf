This was very difficult for me and I spent many days (maybe a week) trying to understand the concepts and complete this mission. I think it's mostly complete. 
When you go to the landing page you get a link to the notes page and then you can interact with the app. I changed up some of the explanation texts as I did spend 
a long time not knowing I could type into the main area! 

I was not able to get the delete fuction to work.
