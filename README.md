I'm not sure how much this is worth at this point, but I have worked many hours on this project. The main branch was Master, 
but I moved it to main because the documents on Heroku said that was best for the application. 
While it worked on my local computer, the best functionality I got when I moved to Heroku was an error page. Sometimes it didn't seem to show up in any capacity for form.  
I did many hours of searching and studying various videos but wasn't able to determine the answer. My suspicion is that I'm making some fundemental problem with pathing.  
I did have three different tutoring sessions and asked the TA for the class for help too. I also regularily attend after and pre-class sessions and have attended all the 
evening sessions JD has offered.  
Others seem to upload to Heroku without issue, so it's clearly some issues with my code.  
This is also the second time I've built it. The first time I had changed some of the source code and my instructors indicated that this maybe why it wasn't working. 
This second build has zero changes on the source code. 

I hope this is worth some points.
